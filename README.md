# Hyperspectral data classification using 1D, 2D and 3D CNNs
> Short blurb about what your product does.

One to two paragraph statement about your product and what it does.


## Installation

Run the corresponding jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file. Tested on Python 3.9.

The required python libraries are described in `requirements.txt`. Most can be installed only using either
```sh
pip install <library name>
```
or
```sh
conda install <library name>
```

However, two libraries require a slightly different installation process under Windows: PyTorch and GDAL Python API:

#### PyTorch installation
Suitable command for PyTorch installation should be selected on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) based on if your computer has a GPU by Nvidia:
* If you have a Nvidia GPU then you can try installing _CUDA toolkit_ and _CuDNN_ from the [Nvidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), you need to sign up for 'NVIDIA Developer Program' in order to download CuDNN (check the PyTorch website first, so you install an appropriate version of _CUDA_ and _CuDNN_). After successfully installing _CUDA toolkit_ and _CuDNN_, install PyTorch using the command from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
* If you do not have a CUDA-capable Nvidia GPU, you can simply use PyTorch on the CPU, by selecting `CPU` in the `Compute Platform` field on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

#### GDAL Python API installation
Based on your preferred Python package manager, install either through

PIP [https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-install-gdal-for-python-with-pip-on-windows/](https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-install-gdal-for-python-with-pip-on-windows/)

or

CONDA [https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-install-gdal-with-anaconda/](https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-install-gdal-with-anaconda/)

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the documentation._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
